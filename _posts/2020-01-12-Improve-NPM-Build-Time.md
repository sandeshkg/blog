# [](#header-1)Improve your node application build time

Few things tried
1. Write about folder navigation, config documentation, module documentation
2. Move the node_modules to the root
3. Set .npmrc during image creation - Doesnt work as azure container builds run with different id.
4. Setting cache 
5. Permission issues and moving to seperate folder
6. Succesfully working
7. Some modules not cached yet
